# Generate an ebook from ACM Queue https://queue.acm.org

As the source html pages are a bit hacky and contains some manual formatting the result is 98% OK: perfectly readable but not perfect.

Use the incredible [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org).

Requirements
- Ruby
- GraphicsMagick

How to use it :
- run the scripts one after another
- fix any error (some html pages containes error that need fixing before they can be properly parsed)

Ping me if you need any help.
